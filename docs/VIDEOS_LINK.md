## What the Video Shows

- Opening and configuring the `MainPipeline.mlx` script  
- Step-by-step preprocessing (slice timing, motion correction, skull stripping)  
- Coregistration and normalization (EPI → T1 → MNI)  
- Atlas projection onto EPI space using Harvard–Oxford atlas  
- ROI time series extraction and visualization  
- Functional connectivity computation (correlation matrices)  
- Opening Volume Viewer  
- Demonstration of where the results are saved (per user/session/task)
